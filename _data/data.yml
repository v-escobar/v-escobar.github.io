career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Experienced Principal Software Engineer with a strong hands-on background in both frontend and backend development, driven by a SecDevOps mindset. 
    I specialize in building scalable, cloud-native applications using JVM-based languages such as **Java** and **Kotlin** for backend services, and 
    **TypeScript** with **Angular** on the frontend.

    Deeply involved in the **entire software development lifecycle**, I've contributed from gathering user requirements and incorporating feedback, 
    to deploying, running, and operating production systems. I bring a holistic approach to software engineering that balances technical excellence 
    with real-world impact.

    In my leadership role, I actively **mentor and coach** engineers to support their career development, and I regularly give **internal tech talks**
    —covering both cutting-edge technologies and effective team collaboration strategies.

    Naturally curious and always eager to learn, I thrive in dynamic environments and embrace new challenges. I'm a strong believer in **team empowerment 
    and psychological safety**—fostering open communication, embracing failure as a learning opportunity, and promoting a **culture of knowledge sharing** 
    and continuous improvement.

    time: 2018 - Present
    company: Novatec Software
    details: |
      Joined as a **Senior Software Engineer** to contribute to a strategic project for one of Germany's leading automotive companies. 
      The mission was to **decommission a legacy monolith** in the aftersales department and modernize it into a **cloud-native microservices 
      platform**. The backend was re-architected using **Spring Boot**, while the frontend was built with **Angular**. **Asynchronous communication** 
      between services was established via **RabbitMQ**, enabling scalable and decoupled workflows.

      Initially deployed on an **on-premises Kubernetes cluster**, the platform underwent multiple infrastructure evolutions. The first major 
      **cloud migration to IBM Cloud** included a successful **database migration**, followed by a second migration to **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. 
      As part of this transition, we introduced **performance and load testing using Gatling** to validate system stability and ensure a smooth 
      migration process.

      In 2023, I was promoted to **Principal Software Engineer** and took over as **Technical Lead** for a critical product within the same platform 
      that was transitioned from a previous supplier. My responsibilities included:

      - **Forming and onboarding a new team** of 10 engineers.
      - **Auditing the existing codebase** and establishing a clear technical roadmap.
      - **Improving code quality and maintainability**, particularly through the introduction of automated testing practices (**JUnit**, **TestContainers**, and **Playwright**).
      - **Integrating SonarQube** to track code coverage and maintain continuous quality standards.

      In 2024, I led the **greenfield development of a new MVP** within a different business domain. Working in close collaboration with business 
      stakeholders, we incorporated **market feedback** into the design to ensure alignment with user needs. After just 9 months, the solution was 
      **successfully rolled out globally**, and I've continued to lead its evolution and scaling.

      The project's infrastructure includes **observability and monitoring tools** such as **Instana** for performance insights and **OpenSearch** for 
      centralized logging, ensuring robust operations and fast incident response.
